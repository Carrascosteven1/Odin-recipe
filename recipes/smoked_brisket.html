    <p>A whole BBQ beef brisket (a.k.a.<em>packer's cut brisket</em> )is a huge hunk of cow that comes off the smoker deep ebony in color, almost black, looking more like a meteorite than a meal. But it is not burnt, and beneath the crust is the most tender,
        juicy, meat full of husky, beefy flavor. IF you cook it right. </p>
